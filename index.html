        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I’m a software engineer focused on frontend development, with a strong passion for creating accessible and
          user-friendly web experiences for everyone, regardless of how they interact with the web.</p>

        <p> I’m a bit of a jack of all trades, with interests that span both hardware and software. I enjoy exploring a
          wide
          range of projects, from building games and audio visualizers to creating real-time, shared collaboration
          platforms. This curiosity across disciplines helps me approach problems from different angles and build
          solutions
          that are thoughtful, practical, and well-engineered.</p>

        <p> I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering, where attention to detail, usability, and
          clean,
          maintainable code come together to create meaningful user experiences.</p>
